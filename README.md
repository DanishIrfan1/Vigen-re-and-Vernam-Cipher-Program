# Vigenère and Vernam Cipher Program

This Python program allows you to perform encryption and decryption using the Vigenère and Vernam ciphers. You can choose between the two cipher methods and provide the necessary inputs to encrypt or decrypt messages.

## Features

1. **Vigenère Cipher**:
    - Encrypts and decrypts text using a keyword.
    - Converts plaintext and keyword to uppercase for processing.

2. **Vernam Cipher**:
    - Encrypts and decrypts text using a binary key.
    - The binary key must be 8 times the length of the plaintext or ciphertext (each character is 8 bits in ASCII).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the `cryptography.py` file.

### Running the Program

```bash
python cryptography.py
```
